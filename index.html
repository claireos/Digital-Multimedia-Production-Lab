<p style="color: antiquewhite;font-style: italic;"> 
    My story is inspired by this Grammy performance, so it was critical to include at the top of my article. The embed tool allows me to insert the video here, so readers don't have to navigate away from my video to see it. Embedding the video was very easy and straightforward.
</p>
<p> Charli XCX brought the party to the 67th Grammy Awards. Her performance began outside the venue and followed Charli as she strutted onstage in true party girl fashion, flanked by her famous and fabulously-dressed friends. She gave a deliciously-raw, unpolished and dynamic performance of hit songs "Von Dutch" and "Guess," dancing with her crew like no one was watching. </p>
<p> But who got the invite to party with Charli? Below is a (non-comprehensive) list of VIPs who appeared onstage with Charli at the Grammys.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Julia Fox</li>
    <li>Alex Consani</li>
    <li>Quen Blackwell</li>
    <li>Gabriette</li>
    <li>The Dare</li>
    <li>Richie Shazam</li>
    <li>Salem Mitchell</li>
    <li>Greer Cohen</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: antiquewhite;font-style: italic;"> My original conceit for this story was to do a deep dive on each of the people who appeared in Charli's Grammy performance, but I shifted my focus to Charli's career in order to make better use of the interactive tools. However, I am very glad we learned how to make unordered lists, as it allowed me to include a brief version of my original idea here.</p>
<h2>...Winner...</h2>
But Charli was at the Grammys for more than just her performance. The pop diva was nominated for eight awards and walked away with her first three Grammy wins. "Von Dutch" won Best Dance Pop Recording and her smash-hit album "BRAT" won Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Recording Package.

<p style="color: antiquewhite;font-style: italic;"> Similarly to the YouTube video at the head of the article, I felt it was critical to directly connect my reader to the thing I am describing. The Spotify embed tool was also very easy to use. </p>
<h3> ...and Brat!</h3>
<p> It's been a big year for Charli. "BRAT" and singles like "Hot Girl" brought mainstream attention to the singer who was once relegated to an artistic niche. Below is a brief timeline of her past releases, including her studio albums and some of her biggest singles.

<p style="color: antiquewhite;font-style: italic;"> I chose to include a timeline/slideshow because I wanted to give my reader a brief overview of Charli XCX's career. If I were to create a more in-depth version of this story, I think I could incorporate in-depth descriptions and add more moments to the timeline to trace her career ascension and artistic growth. I considered adding her entire discography in this version of my timeline, but I followed the Knight Lab suggestion to limit myself to fewer than 20 slides. This tool was more challenging to use, but the Knight Lab resources were extremely helpful. I'm still having an issue getting every photo to load on my timeline. The links appear to be functional in my Google Sheet, so I'm not sure why the images aren't appearing. </p>

In terms of album sales, "BRAT" out-performed all of her previous album releases. Below is a graph showing the UK album sales for each of her six studio albums.

<p class="cutline"> Data Source: Wikipedia</p>
<p style="color: antiquewhite;font-style: italic;"> I created this interactive line-graph to visually demonstrate BRAT's impressive performance, especially compared to her previous releases. The timline tool was the most difficult tool for me to use and I'm not totally satisfied with my final result. I wish I were able to customize the graph colors to align with my chosen color scheme. I'd also like to add that if I were to create a more in-depth version of this story, I would use a source other than Wikipedia to verify my data.   </p>

<p> Charli XCX brought the party to the 67th Grammy Awards. Her performance began outside the venue and followed Charli as she strutted onstage in true party girl fashion, flanked by her famous and fabulously-dressed friends. She gave a deliciously-raw, unpolished and dynamic performance of hit songs "Von Dutch" and "Guess," dancing with her crew like no one was watching. </p>
<p> But who got the invite to party with Charli? Below is a (non-comprehensive list) of fellow-stars who appeared onstage with Charli at the Grammys.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Julia Fox</li>
    <li>Alex Consani</li>
    <li>Quen Blackwell</li>
    <li>Gabriette</li>
    <li>The Dare</li>
    <li>Richie Shazam</li>
    <li>Salem Mitchell</li>
    <li>Greer Cohen</li>
</ul>

<h2>...Winner...</h2>
But Charli was at the Grammys for more than just her performance. The pop diva was nominated for eight awards and walked away with her first three Grammy wins. "Von Dutch" won Best Dance Pop Recording and her smash-hit album "BRAT" won Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Recording Package.
